<h1>Bulk Email Sender</h1>
<p>This script allows you to easily send bulk emails using the <code>smtplib</code> library and <code>email.mime.text</code> module in Python. Simply add the email addresses to the <code>emails.txt</code> file, and a message in the <code>message.txt</code> file, and the script will handle the rest!</p>
<p>It also includes a feature to check for valid email addresses, and removes any invalid addresses from the list before sending.</p>
<p>In case of any errors while sending an email, the script will wait for 5 minutes before continuing, to avoid hitting the email server's sending limit.</p>
<p>It also writes the list of remaining valid emails after sending the emails to the file. </p>
